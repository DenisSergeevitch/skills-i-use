description: "Strict Markdown project management with status.md as the canonical entrypoint: checkbox-only tasks with IDs, acceptance criteria, evidence, and append-only pulse history. Includes no-dependency Bash and Windows (PowerShell/CMD) ticket and collab wrappers for long-running and multi-agent repos."

# PM as Code

## Contract

- Read `status.md` first in every session.
- Treat `status.md` as a generated snapshot; never edit it manually.
- Keep all actionables as checkboxes only: `- [ ]` or `- [x]`.
- Give every task an ID (`T-0001`, `T-0002`, ...), and keep counters in `status.md`.
- Keep required section order exactly as defined in `references/status-template.md`.
- Keep acceptance criteria for active tasks keyed by task ID.
- Treat Pulse history as append-only.
- Resolve ambiguity by updating docs, never by relying on chat memory.
- Route every state mutation through collab wrappers by default:
  - `scripts/pm-collab.sh` (Bash)
  - `scripts/pm-collab.ps1` or `scripts/pm-collab.cmd` (Windows)
- Use `pm-collab run <pm-ticket command...>`; it auto-resolves agent identity and auto-claims task IDs when needed.
- Agent identity resolution order: `PM_AGENT` -> `CODEX_THREAD_ID` -> `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` -> host fallback.
- Use `pm-ticket.*` directly only for read-only/status commands or maintenance.
- Empty state is not a blocker: if `status.md`/`.pm` do not exist yet, run `pm-collab ... init` and continue.
- If repo-local wrappers are missing, invoke installed skill scripts directly (for example from `~/.codex/skills/pm-as-code/scripts/` or `~/.claude/skills/pm-as-code/scripts/`).

## Done Gate

A task is done only when all are true:
- task checkbox is `[x]`
- acceptance criteria are `[x]`
- evidence is recorded
- `Now / In progress / Blocked / Next` are updated
- a new Pulse entry is appended

## Session Loop

1. Read `status.md`.
2. Select scope (`--scope` or `PM_SCOPE`) and ensure initialization (`pm-collab ... init` or automatic bootstrap on first `pm-collab run` mutation).
3. Execute one active task ID (prefer `Now`) with `pm-collab run ...`.
4. If new work appears, create a new task ID immediately via `pm-collab run new ...`.
5. If blocked, move task to `Blocked` with explicit blocker text via `pm-collab run move ...`.
6. On completion, run the Done Gate through `pm-collab run done ...` (render is automatic).

## Mode Selection

Use ledger mode by default:
- `scripts/pm-collab.sh` (Bash)
- `scripts/pm-collab.ps1` or `scripts/pm-collab.cmd` (Windows)
- Prefer scoped ledgers for parallel teams: `--scope <name>` (or `PM_SCOPE`).
- Ledger files in `.pm/scopes/<scope>/*` are the machine record.
- Manual edits to `status.md` are forbidden; script render is authoritative.
- `status.md` is rendered:
  - single default scope: full snapshot
  - multiple scopes (or non-default only): compact scope index to `status.<scope>.md`

Notes:
- `pm-collab run ...` works for both single-agent and multi-agent workflows.
- Explicit `claim`/`unclaim` remains available for manual reservation control.

## Concurrency Policy

Concurrent edits are expected in multi-agent work.

Default behavior:
- Do not hand-edit `status.md` during concurrent work.
- Perform writes through `pm-collab ... run` for lock + claim enforcement.
- Re-render snapshot after task updates.

Escalate only on true same-task conflicts:
- target task ID missing
- duplicated task ID
- acceptance criteria block for that ID cannot be mapped safely

If conflict is true same-task:
- create a new task `Resolve status conflict for <ID>`
- move original task to `Blocked` with blocker noted

For teammate handoffs, use a bounded task pack:
- `scripts/pm-ticket.sh [--scope <name>] render-context <T-0001> [evidence-tail]`
- `scripts/pm-ticket.ps1 [--scope <name>] render-context <T-0001> [evidence-tail]`
